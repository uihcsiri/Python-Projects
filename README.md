## py11-6_Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, Cloth
A game extended from "rock–paper–scissors." In this version, besides the original 3 weapons, it adds another 3 tools: lizard, Spock, cloth.
* Spock: A fictional character in the Star Trek. 
* Fun fact about this version: I knew this through the series "The Big Bang Theory". 

How to Play:
1. Players just need to enter number (1 ~ 6) to choose the weapon they want to use. 
2. The program will randomly choose one weapon, too. 
3. The screen will directly show the result.
4. Players can decide wheher they want to play again by enter 'y' or 'n'.

Note: If the player key in invalid input, the program will ask the players the question again until it receives the valid answer.


## py11-7_Guess the Number
Just as boring as the name, it's a game to guess the number (1 ~ 50) which had determined by the program. Don't worry! The program will give you the hint by showing the range considering your record. 

How to Play:
1. Key a number between 1 and 50.
2. If wrong, the program will show the updated range, and you can guess again. If correct, the program will show the times you have guessed.
3. Players can decide wheher they want to play again by enter 'y' or 'n'.

## py11-11_Lyric Generator_Advanced
I tried to build a lyric repository. After the user key the singer name, the program will show the songlist. Then the user can choose the lyric they want to see by entering the number according the songlist.

Note: Sorry for the simplicity, I only show part of the lyrics and provide limited number of songs.
