## py11-6_Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock, Cloth
Game extended from "rock–paper–scissors." In this version, besides the original 3 weapons, it adds another 3 tools: lizard, Spock, cloth.
* Spock: A fictional character in the Star Trek. 
* Fun fact about this version: I knew this through the series "The Big Bang Theory". 

How to Play:
1. Players just need to enter number (1 ~ 6) to choose the weapon they want to use. 
2. The program will randomly choose one weapon, too. 
3. The screen will directly show the result.
4. Players can decide wheher they want to play again by enter 'y' or 'no'.

Note: If the player key in invalid input, the program will ask the players the question again until it receives the valid answer.
